This GitHub hosted blog was forked from [barryclark/jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). Great gratitude to Barry Clark for his great job. Highly recommend to refer to it if you like the blog style. You may see some differences since this Repository has some personal customizations. Besides, the origin has some unfriendly issues which are fixed in this one. 

Therefore, two choices are for you, fork this one to save your effort or fork the origin one and practice fixing problems on your own.
