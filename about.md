My name is Leipeng. I graduated from Tianjin University with a master degree in structural engineering.

I have been self-learning python for several months. Before that I worked as a structure engineer in a design institute for a year. At that time, I dreamt to be a programmer, and I decided to have a radical career change. When researching new career paths, Data Scientist stood out--I really liked python and enjoyed finding and exploring patterns in our world.

Then here I am.

I know I am not a computer science graduate and that is a big disadvantage for me comparing to those who had professional training. But I am a quick learner. I have endless passion about data science, and about programming. I don’t mind to keep learning new things and work for a long time as long as I recognize the job.


### Best wish for you

Life is full of “if only”. I should be here, I could be there. This path or that path? Do we know what we really want?

Anytime you want something for sure, work with what you got to get what you don't. Don't hesitate. Don't panic.
